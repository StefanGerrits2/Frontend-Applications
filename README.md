![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45566396/67979685-1484a800-fc1d-11e9-932d-c96fbc4388b6.png)

## Description

This is an app to visualize data for NMVW wereldculturen. The data I chose to visualize is all the data about toys. They will be able to see which toys kids had in the past and how they looked. They will be asked which toys they have right now so they can compare them with the past. 

## Features

* Routing in navigation to the different category
* Responsive website

## API

The data I use is provided by an API. The API contains 700.000 objects. I have written SPARQL queries to get the objects that I want. 

I collect all toys which contains from a specific type the following data that I want:

* Title
* Culture
* Time
* Type
* Location
* Size
* Material
