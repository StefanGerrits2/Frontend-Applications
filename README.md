## Description

This is a web application I made for a school project to visualize data for NMVW wereldculturen. The data I chose to visualize is all the data about toys. There are different toy categories you can see. Each toy will has it's own information which will be shown in a list. I made this application with a javascript framework called Svelte.

##### Target audience:

I made this application for children. This way they can compare the toys from the past with the toys they have right now. This will teach them a lot about history in a fun way. They can learn about which materials they used to make toys, which culture it's part of and how toys developed over time in general.

## Features

* Selecting a toy category
* Being able to view all of the toys from that type
* Routing to different toys categories
* Dynamically rendering all data from an API
* Responsive website

### 5. Viewing the website
Open your browser and go to:

`localhost:5000`

## API

The data I use is provided by [this API](https://data.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). The API contains 700.000 objects. I have written SPARQL queries to get the objects that I want. 

I collect all toys from specific categories:

* Dolls
* Toy animals
* Board games
* Toy cars

These categories contain the following data that I get from the API:

* Title
* Culture
* Time
* Type
* Location
* Size
* Material
